# Implementation_of_Statistical_Strategic_Predictions
This is my senior year thesis. I am using this as a backup and a display of my work as a undergrad. I did not complete this, as I only had one semester to write the code. 
I didn't even enjoy the project that much; instead, I wanted to do my ACTUAL thesis project about a specific problem in n-dimmensional Conway's Game of Life. Unfortunately, the professor that I was working with retired (due to covid). 
I was also working on another thesis about protest simulation with one of my classmates.
We lost communication due to covid and decided to scrap the project.
So this is the thesis I did with Professor Alfano instead. Lessons were learned
